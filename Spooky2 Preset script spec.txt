# White Paper: Object Structure of Spooky2 Presets

## 1. Introduction

Spooky2 presets are specialized files used in frequency therapy applications. This white paper aims to provide a detailed explanation of the structure of Spooky2 presets, their components, and the relationships between these components. Understanding this structure is crucial for accurate parsing, generation, and processing of Spooky2 presets.

## 2. Overall Structure of a Spooky2 Preset

A Spooky2 preset consists of three main parts:

1. Opening Tag
2. Preset Content (Header and Frequency Data)
3. Closing Tag

## 3. Spooky2 Preset Structure

### 3.1 Opening and Closing Tags

- Opening Tag: `"[Preset]"`
- Closing Tag: `"[/Preset]"`

These tags encapsulate the entire preset content.

### 3.2 Preset Content

The preset content is composed of key-value pairs, each on a separate line. The content can be divided into two main sections:

1. Header Information
2. Frequency Data

#### 3.2.1 Header Information

The header contains metadata and settings for the preset. Key fields include:

- `"PresetName="`: Name of the preset
- `"Preset_Notes="`: Additional information or copyright notices
- Various settings (e.g., "Repeat_Each_Frequency=", "Out1_Amplitude=", etc.)

Example:
```
"PresetName=Example Preset Name"
"Repeat_Each_Frequency=1"
"Out1_Amplitude=20"
```

#### 3.2.2 Frequency Data

The frequency data consists of two types of entries:

1. Loaded Programs
2. Loaded Frequencies

##### 3.2.2.1 Loaded Programs

Each "Loaded_Programs" entry represents a frequency set. Multiple entries can exist in a single preset.

Format: `"Loaded_Programs=<set_name> <date1> <date2> ..."`

Example:
```
"Loaded_Programs=herpes simplex hepatitis 20100101 20170411 20170929"
```

##### 3.2.2.2 Loaded Frequencies

All frequencies from all sets are combined into a single "Loaded_Frequencies" entry.

Format: `"Loaded_Frequencies=<freq1>=<dwell>,<freq2>=<dwell>,..."`

- Single frequencies: `<frequency>=<dwell>`
- Fuzzed frequencies: `<lower_freq>-<upper_freq>=<dwell>`

Example:
```
"Loaded_Frequencies=45454.45454545=60,54664942.6162-54670409.3838=60,..."
```

## 4. Object Representation

When parsing a Spooky2 preset, it can be represented as an object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "header": {
    "presetName": "Example Preset Name",
    "presetNotes": "Copyright notice and additional information",
    "settings": {
      "repeatEachFrequency": 1,
      "out1Amplitude": 20,
      // ... other settings ...
    }
  },
  "frequencySets": [
    {
      "name": "herpes simplex hepatitis",
      "dates": ["20100101", "20170411", "20170929"],
      "frequencies": [
        {
          "type": "single",
          "value": 45454.45454545,
          "dwell": 60
        },
        {
          "type": "fuzzed",
          "lowerValue": 54664942.6162,
          "upperValue": 54670409.3838,
          "dwell": 60
        },
        // ... more frequencies ...
      ]
    },
    // ... more frequency sets ...
  ]
}
```

## 5. Parsing Considerations

When parsing a Spooky2 preset:

1. All key-value pairs are enclosed in double quotes.
2. The "Loaded_Frequencies" string may be very long and contain thousands of frequencies.
3. Frequency values should be parsed with high precision (at least 8 decimal places).
4. Dwell times are typically in seconds and are usually integers.

## 6. Generation Considerations

When generating a Spooky2 preset:

1. Ensure all key-value pairs are enclosed in double quotes.
2. Combine all frequencies from all sets into a single "Loaded_Frequencies" string.
3. Use 8 decimal places for frequency values when possible.
4. Ensure the preset is enclosed within the "[Preset]" and "[/Preset]" tags.

## 7. Conclusion

Understanding the structure of Spooky2 presets is crucial for working with frequency therapy data. This white paper provides a comprehensive guide to the components of a Spooky2 preset, their relationships, and how they should be structured in a parsed object. Adherence to this structure will ensure consistent and correct interpretation of Spooky2 presets across different systems and applications working with frequency therapy data.
